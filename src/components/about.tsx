        <h2>Career Summary</h2>
        <p>
          After spending 15 years in various operational and implementation
          roles within Ed Tech, Shawn felt unsure of his exact career
          trajectory. Therefore after considering what excited him about his
          work experiences, all signs pointed to working with, and supporting,
          the technology that powered the products and the users. Therefore, he
          decided to take a professional pause and enrolled in the three month
          immersive Full Stack Web Development bootcamp with&nbsp;

          >
            Suncoast Developers Guild
          </a>
          .&nbsp;In this full-time bootcamp, Shawn pursued the skills and
          knowledge that offers opportunities to be hands-on with building and
          supporting the products created and consumed by the end-user.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shawn is a multifaceted professional who is interested in pursuing a
          career that leverages his professional experience while focusing on
          web development with interests in front end coding, QA and information
          architecture; as well as supporting agile project management and
          business analysis functions. He has an appetite to learn, is flexible,
          curious, analytical, and has a knack for ensuring results are in line
          with expected outcomes and requirements. He possesses experience with
          agile software development and the tools used to support this approach
          through the SDLC.

          identifying gaps with the overall information architecture and flow in
          bringing together three landing pages together under one main website
          in a cohesive manner.

          <em>
            I&#39;m already getting positive feedback on our new landing pages!
            There are so many things that were so amazing about being a part of
            TechSoup/Techies for Good Dev Day. Everyone was genuinely interested
            in my work with the Baltimore Job Hunters Support Group and our
            expansion via our umbrella nonprofit LifeCareerPivoteers. Everyone
            was very supportive and kind. It&#39;s hard to describe the feeling
            I got when I saw all that got done on Saturday; the results were
            amazing. There is so much to attend to getting 3 websites going and
            it is something that I couldn&#39;t have done on my own, and I
            appreciate their willingness to work with a platform that I was used
            to.
            <br />
            <br /> Iâ€™m so grateful for tech people who are interested in helping
            nonprofits. I know that their skill and expertise is so valuable and
            the assistance I&#39;ve received would have cost thousands, so
            I&#39;m really in awe of everyone&#39;s generosity.
